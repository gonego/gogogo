/*
This package is used to showcase of the workings of the whole suite of
test functions, testable examples and benchmark testing. The package functions,
created as basis for testing, are rather simple. However, even the most trivial
functions need to be tested from all angles, lest some extreme values or even,
absence of values, can render a function useless. This is especially true when
a potential of error of division by zero goes undetected or obscured by the
simplicity of the function algorithm.

	 function NewAverange -  potential for division by zero is checked by if statement
	 function NewSum      -  addition by a slice of zero value does not pose as error
